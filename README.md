# DoLand-Case

# I just started a completely new project with "npx create-react-app", so adding the "App.css" and "App.js" should 
# just replace the old ones. Otherwise I have "node.js" and "npm" installed, and run the project as a localhost 
# with "npm start" to get the website running in the browser. I hope it works!
